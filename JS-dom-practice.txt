This is one of my more recent ventures, a practice in javascript DOM.
The criteria for this was to not use any html elements and fill the web page entirely with javascript DOM elements.
The concept of this was quite easy to understand and having a fair bit of programming skill after taking the break from school and coming back I got most of these projects with minimal effort.
It was quite fun to work on these even though I could've done these projects at a faster pace than the course allowed for.
