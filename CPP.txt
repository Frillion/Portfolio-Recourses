This is a collection of projects the where developed at the c++ course at the Tech collage of Iceland.
Everything I did leading up to the Booking command line program can be found in this repository.
Just minor console apps to practice specific things we learned about the laguage such as pointers,
linked lists and how classes worked in c++ vs. Python.
