This is a collection of three projects working on a mock mysql database for a website that manages what courses and tracks students are taking.
Project1 is setup for the progresstracker database and a bunch of stored procedures and functions to fetch specific data or create some courses.
Project2 is the adding of triggers to make sure that students can take specific courses and to add the first semester.
Project3 are stored procedures returning specific data in JSON format so that it could be called and parsed from a different program one that we didnt make in this course but later on i did.
This was during the phase at which i experienced massive burnout from school so I did fail this semester but later on i retook this course with more determination and passed with a full 10/10.
The course was quite a nice experience it was just a shame that I didn't have the energy to continue at that moment.
