This was the very first course i took for programming in general and its nice too look back to see how far ive come since then.
I had been interested in coding before that and dabbled a little in it before going into this but this was my first big forte into it.
These programs are extremely simple and im sure I could make them better with the knowledge I have today.
The skills on display here go from basic python syntax up to using classes, functions and various datastructures in python e.g. dicts,lists and tuples.
At the end of the day this is where it all began and now its still goin to this day and will go on till the end of my days and I cant wait to start working in this industry.
