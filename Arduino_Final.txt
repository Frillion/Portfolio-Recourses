This was the final project i did in a hardware/Arduino course at the Tech college of Iceland.
Although this is a final project its far from the last time I picked up a microcontroller.
It was quite a fun project to work on, the way it works is that the sonar, hooked onto a small motor,
spins around in a searching pattern back and forth untill the ultra sonic sensor picks up an object infront of it.
If the sonar finds a target it stops the motor in place untill the object is moved away.
There is also an option to take controll with a little joystick.
