This is the final project for a course at the Tech collage of Iceland preparing you for the CCNA, this is the second of four courses, Routing and Switching.
The senario set up is a company with 4 branches all over iceland and it has the same network topology in each branch.
What is needed to set up is vlans, native management vlans, ripv2 for routers and dhcp.
Ofcourse while doing all this setup we need to consider security aswell so setting up passwords and restricting access with access lists and such.
This was a fine project altho now a days we would set these things up programmatically using APIs.
