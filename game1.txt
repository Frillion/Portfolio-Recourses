This was the first project for a game development course at the Tech college of Iceland.
This was something we did before jumping into the unity game engine, just answering a few questions.
Some questions where just what a game loop is, what a game engine is, what assest are etc..
Not really my cup of tea in terms of learing I like doing something more productive when I learn, gets you more familliar with the environment you'll be working in.
