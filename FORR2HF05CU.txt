This was the third course i took of python programming at the Tech collage of Iceland.
In this course we did a veriety of small practice programs ranging from working with classes to python datastructures and string manipulation.
At the end of the course we even played around with a library called pygame to make a little game, so that experiance was pretty fun.
This was the start of my development journey in a sense, where i got the grips on python and was ready to move on to other languages.
Today i keep going at a more rapid pace than ever before learing more and more about this field I love.
