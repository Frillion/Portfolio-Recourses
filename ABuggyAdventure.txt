This was a game development project using unity c# that I started on for the sake of taking part in a 1 month GameJam.
The theme of the Jam was bugs so I got together with a friend and we brainstormed a few ideas.
The idea settled upon was a little adventure game themed around insects and to have some wierd intentional
bugs the player could exploit therefore incorporating the theme in two different ways.
This project was a promising one but unfortunately it stays unfinished to this day and was never submitted to the Jam.
