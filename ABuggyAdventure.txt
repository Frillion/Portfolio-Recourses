This was a game development project using unity c# that i started on for the sake of taking part in a 1 month GameJam.
The theme of the Jam was bugs so i got together with a friend and we brainstormed a few ideas.
The idea settled uppon was a little adventure game themed around insects and to have some wierd intentional
bugs the player could exploit therefore incorporating that theme in two different ways.
This project was a promissing one but sadly it stays unfinished to this day and was never submitted to the Jam.
