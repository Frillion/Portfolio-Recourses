This is a collection over an entire semester at the Tech college of Iceland.
I got really into using git version controll at this time so I decided to put all the projects in one repository.
It contains a bunch of projects for mysql databases, python programming, networking, and python web app development.
Fine semester and I passed all the classes with a fairly high degree of success.
