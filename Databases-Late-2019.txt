This is the same collection from DatabaseCourse2020 but its the first ever time I took this course.
The signs of burnout where first experienced here, where motivation was hanging on by a thread, enough to pass my other courses but not enough to finish this one.
Today I look back on this having learned to manage the feeling of burnout much better with more dicapline and this is the biggest moment of teaching.
This was a fine course but just a bad time in the game of life.
