This is a project that I am quite proud of, it was made for a javascript course at the Tech college of Iceland.
The project is a Single Page Application, SPA for short, where paintings are listed for sale.
The main meat of the webpage are the various filters that sort the paintings based off artist name, artwork name, date from,date to and price.
This did take a while to get completely right but it wasnt too much of a hastle.
Lovley little project to work on.
