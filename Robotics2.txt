This is a Project we worked on for a vex robotics competition at the Tech college of Iceland.
We had to design a robot to compete in the vex tower takeover that we hosted in class.
The design me and my partner settled on is a claw bot that has a cage on the end of its arm to stack cubes.
Over all things went well even if we had to revisit designs over and over again.
Eventually we had to scrap the cage for a smaller one since it was just too heavy for the motors and the frame of the bot.
We did fine in the competition and it was rather fun.
