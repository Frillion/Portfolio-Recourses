This is a Project being worked on for a vex robotics competition at the Tech collage of Iceland.
We have to design a robot to compete in the vex tower takeover that we will host in class.
The design me and my partner settled on is a claw bot that has a cage on the end of its arm to stack cubes.
Im excited to see how this tuns out in the end, lets hope we can pull this off in style.
