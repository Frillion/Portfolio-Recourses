This repository holds a collection of projects conected to the third course, out of four, required 
before taking the cisco certified network associate test.
This course was fine and I did fairly well in it, although I never went on to finish the ccna.
The course was quite a big step for networking knowledge, moving beyond small isolated networks to working with the WAN
and business networks.
