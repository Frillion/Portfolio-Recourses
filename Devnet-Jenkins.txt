This repository holds all of the files that where needed for the devnet course for making a Docker Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
Using Jenkins for the first time was quite an interesting experience since i hadnt really heard of what devops was before this course.
Now however i hear that term get thrown around every corner and it feels so good to properly understand what is being talked about.
Over all a great experience to get this certification.
