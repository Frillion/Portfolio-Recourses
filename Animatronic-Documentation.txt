This project was a final for an electronics/Arduino course at the Tech collage of Iceland.
It was a fairly exciting project cause the concept was that we where making an animatronic halloween decoration.
We got to concept the design and what movements it was supposed to do but unfortunately this project got left unfinished
after a lack of showing up to class by most of the group members and hardware not being a strong suit of mine.
